Thinking About an Allotment Plot ?

‘’Allotments have been in existence for hundreds of years, with evidence pointing back to
Anglo-Saxon times. But the system we recognise today has its roots in the Nineteenth
Century, when land was given over to the labouring poor for the provision of food growing.
This measure was desperately needed thanks to the rapid industrialisation of the country
and the lack of a welfare state.

In 1908 the Small Holdings and Allotments Act came into
force, placing a duty on local authorities to provide sufficient allotments, according to
demand. However, it wasn’t until the end of the First World War that land was made
available to all, primarily as a way of assisting returning service men (Land Settlement
Facilities Act 1919) instead of just the labouring poor. ‘’

Measured in Rods, a full size Allotment plot of 10 x 5 rods should provide enough vegetables
to feed a family of four each year, if fully cultivated.

A Rod derives from Anglo-Saxon being the rod or pole used to control a team of oxen when
working on land. It measures 5.5 yards or 5.03 metres.
To enable as many people as possible to have an allotment plot the majority of our plots are
divided into two. A half plot of 5 x 2.5 rods equally 312.5 square metres. A half plot costs
£25.00 per annum to Lease.
When seen this is quite a large area and does require a significant time commitment of a
minimum of 4 – 6 hours every week to maintain cultivation and beat the weeds.

The Allotment is a friendly place and plot holders are good at supporting newcomers with
advice on what grows well, what’s a weed and styles of cultivation.
Allotments are popular so there is always a Waiting List. Before completing an application
form, please read the Allotment Rules and Regs which will tell you of your obligation if you
decide to go ahead and apply.

You need to be self-reliant in maintaining and cultivating a plot as the Allotment does not
have a power supply and the water supply is accessed via galvanised tanks situated around
the site using a watering can. No hoses are permitted on site.

The full costs of a half plot are £25.00 annual lease fee plus £5.00 subs to the National
Allotment Association, also a refundable deposit of £20.00 for the gate key.
