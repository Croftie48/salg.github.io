Seaford Allotments are situated within the residential area of Seaford enclosed by Vale Road, Hindover Road, Haven Brow and Sutton Drove, with the main entrance in Sutton Drove.
They are available for Seaford and Bishopstone residents.
There are over 200 allotments consisting of full and half plots. There is a mains water supply feeding water tanks positioned around the allotment site. Also on site is a large shed where compost, seeds and second-hand tools can be purchased by plot holders and members of Seaford Horticultural Society. In 2015 with the help of grants from the National Lottery and Seaford Town Council a compost toilet was purchased, solar power is used for the fan and lighting. The solar power also provides lighting in winter for the sales shed.

Half of the allotment site is flat and the remaining area is on a slope. On part of the land on the Vale Road boundary a line of native British trees were planted as whips in 2015 which now provides excellent autumnal colour and a home for birds and other wildlife. This protects a conservation area of a wildflower meadow and micro orchard. There is also a Hazel Copse surrounded by a dead hedge also providing a home for wildlife. This was all achievable with the help of the grants and our volunteers.
The Allotment Site has an open day annually in June in aid of the National Garden Scheme charities [as shown in the photograph].

### History:
The allotment site was purchased by the Urban District Council of Seaford in 1922 for use as allotments for the ‘labouring’ population of Seaford.
In 1986 a group of plot holders formed a Society for the plot holders to keep the site organised and tidy, and give them a voice to prevent the land being taken over for development by the landowners, Lewes District Council. The Society was named as the Allotment Section of Seaford & District Horticultural Society.
In 1990 the Seaford Allotment Society was formed as an independent group.
In 1999 the site was transferred from Lewes District Council to Seaford Town Council and in March 2000 the Society negotiated a self-management agreement with Seaford Town Council who are the landlords.
